# Food-Delivery-App-Database-Management-System

**Introduction**

This project is a Food Delivery App Database Management System designed to efficiently manage and analyze real-time data for an online food delivery service. The system enables customers to order food from their preferred restaurants, ensuring fast deliveries and high customer satisfaction. It focuses on three main aspects: Customers, Restaurants, and Deliveries to maintain service quality.

**Features**

*Customer Interaction*: Customers can browse and order food from restaurants in their area through the app.

*Order Management*: Orders are tracked in real-time, from placement to delivery, ensuring quick service and transparency.

*Delivery System*: Manages delivery agents and monitors the status of deliveries, optimizing for speed and reliability.

*Feedback Registration*: After every order, customer feedback is recorded to help improve service quality and ensure restaurants and delivery agents meet high standards.

*Restaurant Management*: Restaurants can update their menus and receive orders, with detailed tracking of food preparation and delivery times.


**Database Overview**

The database system follows an entity-relationship model that captures key interactions within the app, including:

Customer: Stores customer details like name, contact, and addresses.

Delivery Address: Manages customer-specific delivery addresses.

Restaurant: Captures information about restaurants, including their menus and working hours.

Menu: Stores details of food items, courses, and availability.

Order: Tracks order details, including payments, delivery status, and customer preferences.

Delivery Agent: Manages information about delivery personnel.

Feedback: Records customer feedback on both restaurant services and delivery performance.


**Purpose**

This project aims to streamline the food ordering and delivery process, leveraging the power of a relational database system to manage orders, customer interactions, and service quality effectively. The registered feedback ensures that the system continues to improve based on real-time data.

**1. Retrieve all orders for a specific customer
This query retrieves all the orders placed by a specific customer, identified by their email.**


SELECT O.OrderKey, O.TotalPrice, O.Tax, O.Tip, O.TimeOfOrder, R.Name AS RestaurantName 
FROM `Order` O
JOIN Customer C ON O.CustomerFK = C.CustomerKey
JOIN Restaurant R ON O.RestaurantFK = R.RestaurantKey
WHERE C.Email = 'customer@example.com';



**2. Find the highest-rated restaurant
This query identifies the restaurant with the highest average rating based on customer feedback.**


SELECT R.Name, AVG(F.RestaurantRating) AS AverageRating
FROM Restaurant R
JOIN Feedback F ON R.RestaurantKey = F.RestaurantFK
GROUP BY R.Name
ORDER BY AverageRating DESC
LIMIT 1;




**3. List delivery agents and their average delivery time
This query calculates the average delivery time for each delivery agent.**


SELECT D.FirstName, D.LastName, AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, O.TimeOfOrder, O.TimeOfDelivery)) AS AvgDeliveryTime
FROM DeliveryAgent D
JOIN `Order` O ON D.DeliveryAgentKey = O.DeliveryAgentFK
GROUP BY D.FirstName, D.LastName;


**4. Get total revenue generated by each restaurant
This query calculates the total revenue generated by each restaurant.**

SELECT R.Name, SUM(O.TotalPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Restaurant R
JOIN `Order` O ON R.RestaurantKey = O.RestaurantFK
GROUP BY R.Name
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;



**Query Optimization Techniques**

Indexes: We applied indexing on key columns such as CustomerKey, RestaurantKey, OrderKey, and MenuKey. This reduces the time taken to retrieve data for frequent lookups by orders, customers, and restaurants.

Joins and Filtering: Instead of selecting large datasets and filtering later, queries are optimized to use JOIN conditions that limit the dataset from the beginning. For example, when retrieving customer orders, we join the Customer and Order tables using indexed foreign keys.

Aggregation: For calculating metrics like average delivery time or total revenue, GROUP BY operations are optimized by ensuring indexed columns are used wherever possible, which speeds up aggregation queries.

Query Limiting: For large datasets, we limit the results using LIMIT to prevent unnecessary full table scans when only the top results are needed.

Caching Results: Frequently accessed data such as restaurant names and customer details are cached on the application side to avoid multiple database hits for the same query results.
